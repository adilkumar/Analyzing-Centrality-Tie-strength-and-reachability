# Analyzing-Centrality-Tie-strength-and-reachability

Analyzing centrality, tie strength, and reachability in a class-
room network
Loading classroom data
For this exercise, we will analyze centrality, tie strength, and reachability measures on a dierent
classroom network than the network of MBA students we looked at in class. This network can be
read from the le social_and_task_network.csv.
In this network, we have two types of ties:
1. social_tie indicates whether a student reports having a social relationship with another
student
2. task_tie indicates whether a student reports working with another student on course-related
tasks inside or outside of class
This network has several important characteristics:
 Both of these relationships are directed, that is, not necessarily symmetric or reciprocated.
For example, Student A may report having a relationship with Student B, while Student B
may not report having a relationship with Student A.
 This network is in the form of an edge list, where each row represents a potential tie.
 Ego is the focal node, or vertex, in the networkego sends ties.
 Alter is the non-focal node, or vertex, in the networkalters receive ties from ego.
 The number given in the social_tie and social_tie columns represents the strength of
each tiethis is a weight. If this number is given as 0, then no tie exists between ego and
alter for this type of relationship.
1. First, consider the social and task ties as separate networks.
(A) Use igraph to generate indegree, outdegree, closeness, betweenness, and PageRank cen-
trality statistics for each individual the social and task networks.
(B) Compute the correlations of the ve centrality measures you generate for the social
network with the ve measures generated for the task network. Which measures in the
task network are most closely related to those in the socializing network? Name at least
one insight can you draw from the relationships between these ve measures across the
two networks.
2. Next, consider the social and task ties together, as two distinct types of ties comprising one
network.
(A) Suppose that a tie is strong if it is above the mean strength for that type, conditional on
the tie existingdo not include weights of 0 in the calculation of the mean. Under this
denition, does the network satisfy Strong Triadic Closure? Come up with a solution
that illustrates this (1) visually, in a plot, as well as (2) programmatically, by giving the
number or proportion of ties that are violation of Strong Triadic Closure.
(B) Now suppose that a tie is strong if it is above the median strength for that type,
conditional on the tie existing. Under this denition, does the network satisfy Strong
Triadic Closure? What insights does this illustrate about these interactions within the
network?
3. Continue to treat the social and task ties as two distinct types ties comprising one network.

(A) It is also possible to compute betweenness on the edges in a network, as well as the
vertices. This is a good measure of the ow of information and resources through a
network. Calculate the edge-level betweenness for both of the types of tie.
(B) Does it seem like edges with high betweenness tend to be strong or weak ties, according
to our two denitions above? Does this result make sense?
4. Continue to treat the social and task ties as two distinct types of ties comprising one network.
How many pairs of nodes do not have walks between one another? Find a solution that
performs this calculation directly on the matrixit is possible to verify this solution via
igraph afterward.
5. The network-level measure of degree centrality is a good indicator of the dispersion of the
degree distribution in a network. Generate and plot a network in R in which the network-level
measure of degree centrality,
Cdegree =
Pn
i=1
Cdegree(v)ô€€€Cdegree(vi)
(nô€€€1)(nô€€€2)
is equal to 1, and another where it is equal to 0. Would this relationship hold true for these
networks for other measures of centrality, such as closeness or betweenness?
